I've created websites to showcase friends' photography as a fun project for myself. Entitled Shi Studios, each site practices something new with HTML, CSS, JQuery, and JavaScript.

Hey! I’m Mike Shi, creator of Shi Studios.
I’m 19 and currently a second year student at the University of Toronto for Computer Engineering.
I’ve decided to create this website as a fun project for me, and also a way for my friends to showcase their photography.
I’ve tried to do something new related to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery, as practice on each page. 
Thus, each page has a sub-title underneath the photographer, telling the reader what I attempted on that page.
While most social media links don’t go anywhere yet, the email works and I’ll be setting up contacts in the future!

Additional Notes:

Will continue adding pages as friends want me to create pages for them.
Format may begin to look similiar since the minimalistic look is very popular.
Still trying to learn something new in webdev with each page hopefully!

Known Issues:

Screen Sizes. I'm using bootstrap and will begin making websites mobile friendly.
Appearence differs for some divs between mac and windows laptop. Harder to diagnose becase I don't own a mac but I'll work on it.
